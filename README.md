# Portfolio95

A retro style portfolio website inspired by the aesthetics of Windows 95.

The website serves as my personal portfolio to showcase my projects, skills, and contact information in an interactive and nostalgic interface reminiscent of the Windows 95 operating system. Users can navigate through different windows, open applications, and experience a unique blend of old school design rebuilt with modern web technologies.

If you'd like to explore the portfolio, please visit this [link](https://0x1kero.dev/).
